java.utilClass UUID
java.lang.Objectjava.util.UUID
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable, Comparable<UUID>


```
public final class UUID
extends Object
implements Serializable, Comparable<UUID>
```
A class that represents an immutable universally unique identifier (UUID).
A UUID represents a 128-bit value.There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods
of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
constructors allow the creation of any variant of UUID (described below).The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) UUID is as follows:
The most significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:
```

 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
 0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
 0x000000000000F000 version
 0x0000000000000FFF time_hi
 
```
The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:
```

 0xC000000000000000 variant
 0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node
 
```
The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the
`UUID`. The bit layout described above is valid only for a `UUID` with a variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.The version field holds a value that describes the type of this `UUID`. There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE
security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs. These types have a
version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.For more information including algorithms used to create `UUID`s,
see  RFC 4122: A
Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace, section 4.2
"Algorithms for Creating a Time-Based UUID".

### Constructor Detail

#### UUID

```
public UUID(long mostSigBits,
            long leastSigBits)
```
Constructs a new `UUID` using the specified data. `mostSigBits` is used for the most significant 64 bits of the `UUID` and `leastSigBits` becomes the least significant 64 bits of
the `UUID`.
Parameters:
`mostSigBits` - The most significant bits of the `UUID`
`leastSigBits` - The least significant bits of the `UUID`

### Method Detail

#### randomUUID

```
public static UUID randomUUID()
```
Static factory to retrieve a type 4 (pseudo randomly generated) UUID.
The `UUID` is generated using a cryptographically strong pseudo
random number generator.
Returns:
A randomly generated `UUID`

#### nameUUIDFromBytes

```
public static UUID nameUUIDFromBytes(byte[] name)
```
Static factory to retrieve a type 3 (name based) `UUID` based on
the specified byte array.
Parameters:
`name` - A byte array to be used to construct a `UUID`
Returns:
A `UUID` generated from the specified array

#### fromString

```
public static UUID fromString(String name)
```
Creates a `UUID` from the string standard representation as
described in the `toString()` method.
Parameters:
`name` - A string that specifies a `UUID`
Returns:
A `UUID` with the specified value
Throws:
`IllegalArgumentException` - If name does not conform to the string representation as
described in `toString()`

#### getLeastSignificantBits

```
public long getLeastSignificantBits()
```
Returns the least significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value.
Returns:
The least significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value

#### getMostSignificantBits

```
public long getMostSignificantBits()
```
Returns the most significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value.
Returns:
The most significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value

#### version

```
public int version()
```
The version number associated with this `UUID`. The version
number describes how this `UUID` was generated.
The version number has the following meaning:1 Time-based UUID2 DCE security UUID3 Name-based UUID4 Randomly generated UUID
Returns:
The version number of this `UUID`

#### variant

```
public int variant()
```
The variant number associated with this `UUID`. The variant
number describes the layout of the `UUID`.
The variant number has the following meaning:0 Reserved for NCS backward compatibility2 IETF RFC 4122
(Leach-Salz), used by this class6 Reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility7 Reserved for future definition
Returns:
The variant number of this `UUID`

#### timestamp

```
public long timestamp()
```
The timestamp value associated with this UUID.The 60 bit timestamp value is constructed from the time\_low,
time\_mid, and time\_hi fields of this `UUID`. The resulting
timestamp is measured in 100-nanosecond units since midnight,
October 15, 1582 UTC.The timestamp value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which
has version type 1. If this `UUID` is not a time-based UUID then
this method throws UnsupportedOperationException.
Returns:
The timestamp of this `UUID`.
Throws:
`UnsupportedOperationException` - If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID

#### clockSequence

```
public int clockSequence()
```
The clock sequence value associated with this UUID.The 14 bit clock sequence value is constructed from the clock
sequence field of this UUID. The clock sequence field is used to
guarantee temporal uniqueness in a time-based UUID.The `clockSequence` value is only meaningful in a time-based
UUID, which has version type 1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID
then this method throws UnsupportedOperationException.
Returns:
The clock sequence of this `UUID`

`UnsupportedOperationException` - If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID

#### node

```
public long node()
```

UUID. This field is intended to hold the IEEE 802 address of the machine
that generated this UUID to guarantee spatial uniqueness.The node value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which has
version type 1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID then this method
throws UnsupportedOperationException.
Returns:
The node value of this `UUID`
Throws:
`UnsupportedOperationException` - If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID

#### toString

```
public String toString()
```
Returns a `String` object representing this `UUID`.The UUID string representation is as described by this BNF:
```

 
 UUID                   = <time_low> "-" <time_mid> "-"
                          <time_high_and_version> "-"
                          <variant_and_sequence> "-"
