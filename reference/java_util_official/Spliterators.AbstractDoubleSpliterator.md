All Implemented Interfaces:
Spliterator<Double>, Spliterator.OfDouble, Spliterator.OfPrimitive<Double,DoubleConsumer,Spliterator.OfDouble>

Enclosing class:
Spliterators


```
public abstract static class Spliterators.AbstractDoubleSpliterator
extends Object
implements Spliterator.OfDouble
```
An abstract `Spliterator.OfDouble` that implements
`trySplit` to permit limited parallelism.To implement a spliterator an extending class need only
implement `Spliterator.OfDouble.tryAdvance(java.util.function.DoubleConsumer)`
tryAdvance}. The extending class should override
`Spliterator.OfDouble.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.DoubleConsumer)` forEach} if
it can provide a more performant implementation.
API Note:
This class is a useful aid for creating a spliterator when it is not
possible or difficult to efficiently partition elements in a manner
allowing balanced parallel computation.An alternative to using this class, that also permits limited
parallelism, is to create a spliterator from an iterator
(see `Spliterators.spliterator(java.util.PrimitiveIterator.OfDouble, long, int)`.
Depending on the circumstances using an iterator may be easier or more
convenient than extending this class. For example, if there is already an
iterator available to use then there is no need to extend this class.
Since:
1.8

### Constructor Detail

#### AbstractDoubleSpliterator

```
protected AbstractDoubleSpliterator(long est,
                                    int additionalCharacteristics)
```
Creates a spliterator reporting the given estimated size and
characteristics.
Parameters:
`est` - the estimated size of this spliterator if known, otherwise
`Long.MAX_VALUE`.
`additionalCharacteristics` - properties of this spliterator's
source or elements. If `SIZED` is reported then this
spliterator will additionally report `SUBSIZED`.

### Method Detail

#### trySplit

```
public Spliterator.OfDouble trySplit()
```
If this spliterator can be partitioned, returns a Spliterator
covering elements, that will, upon return from this method, not
be covered by this Spliterator.If this Spliterator is `Spliterator.ORDERED`, the returned Spliterator
must cover a strict prefix of the elements.Unless this Spliterator covers an infinite number of elements,
repeated calls to `trySplit()` must eventually return `null`.
Upon non-null return:the value reported for `estimateSize()` before splitting,
must, after splitting, be greater than or equal to `estimateSize()`
for this and the returned Spliterator; andif this Spliterator is `SUBSIZED`, then `estimateSize()`
for this spliterator before splitting must be equal to the sum of
`estimateSize()` for this and the returned Spliterator after
splitting.This method may return `null` for any reason,
including emptiness, inability to split after traversal has
commenced, data structure constraints, and efficiency
considerations.
This implementation permits limited parallelism.
Specified by:
`trySplit` in interface `Spliterator<Double>`
Specified by:
`trySplit` in interface `Spliterator.OfDouble`
Specified by:
`trySplit` in interface `Spliterator.OfPrimitive<Double,DoubleConsumer,Spliterator.OfDouble>`
Returns:
a `Spliterator` covering some portion of the
elements, or `null` if this spliterator cannot be split

#### estimateSize

```
public long estimateSize()
```
Returns an estimate of the number of elements that would be
encountered by a `Spliterator.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer<? super T>)` traversal, or returns `Long.MAX_VALUE` if infinite, unknown, or too expensive to compute.If this Spliterator is `Spliterator.SIZED` and has not yet been partially
traversed or split, or this Spliterator is `Spliterator.SUBSIZED` and has
not yet been partially traversed, this estimate must be an accurate
count of elements that would be encountered by a complete traversal.
Otherwise, this estimate may be arbitrarily inaccurate, but must decrease
as specified across invocations of `Spliterator.trySplit()`.
Specified by:
`estimateSize` in interface `Spliterator<Double>`
Implementation Requirements:
This implementation returns the estimated size as reported when
created and, if the estimate size is known, decreases in size when
split.
Returns:
the estimated size, or `Long.MAX_VALUE` if infinite,
unknown, or too expensive to compute.

#### characteristics

```
public int characteristics()
```
Returns a set of characteristics of this Spliterator and its
elements. The result is represented as ORed values from `Spliterator.ORDERED`, `Spliterator.DISTINCT`, `Spliterator.SORTED`, `Spliterator.SIZED`,
`Spliterator.NONNULL`, `Spliterator.IMMUTABLE`, `Spliterator.CONCURRENT`,
`Spliterator.SUBSIZED`. Repeated calls to `characteristics()` on
a given spliterator, prior to or in-between calls to `trySplit`,
should always return the same result.If a Spliterator reports an inconsistent set of
characteristics (either those returned from a single invocation
or across multiple invocations), no guarantees can be made
about any computation using this Spliterator.
Specified by:
`characteristics` in interface `Spliterator<Double>`
Implementation Requirements:
This implementation returns the characteristics as reported when
created.
Returns:
a representation of characteristics
