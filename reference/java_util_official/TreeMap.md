java.utilClass TreeMap<K,V>
java.lang.Objectjava.util.AbstractMap<K,V>java.util.TreeMap<K,V>
Type Parameters:
`K` - the type of keys maintained by this map
`V` - the type of mapped values

All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable, Cloneable, Map<K,V>, NavigableMap<K,V>, SortedMap<K,V>


```
public class TreeMap<K,V>
extends AbstractMap<K,V>
implements NavigableMap<K,V>, Cloneable, Serializable
```
A Red-Black tree based `NavigableMap` implementation.
The map is sorted according to the natural
ordering of its keys, or by a `Comparator` provided at map
creation time, depending on which constructor is used.This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the
`containsKey`, `get`, `put` and `remove`
operations. Algorithms are adaptations of those in Cormen, Leiserson, and
Rivest's Introduction to Algorithms.Note that the ordering maintained by a tree map, like any sorted map, and
whether or not an explicit comparator is provided, must be consistent
with `equals` if this sorted map is to correctly implement the
`Map` interface. (See `Comparable` or `Comparator` for a
precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because
the `Map` interface is defined in terms of the `equals`
operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its `compareTo` (or `compare`) method, so two keys that are deemed equal by
this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map, equal. The behavior
of a sorted map is well-defined even if its ordering is
inconsistent with `equals`; it just fails to obey the general contract
of the `Map` interface.Note that this implementation is not synchronized.
If multiple threads access a map concurrently, and at least one of the
threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized
externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or
deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated
with an existing key is not a structural modification.) This is
typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
encapsulates the map.
If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
`Collections.synchronizedSortedMap`
method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the map:
```

   SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap(...));
```
The iterators returned by the `iterator` method of the collections
returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are
fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
`remove` method, the iterator will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw `ConcurrentModificationException` on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.All `Map.Entry` pairs returned by methods in this class
and its views represent snapshots of mappings at the time they were
produced. They do not support the `Entry.setValue`
method. (Note however that it is possible to change mappings in the
associated map using `put`.)This class is a member of the
Java Collections Framework.

### Constructor Detail

#### TreeMap

```
public TreeMap()
```
Constructs a new, empty tree map, using the natural ordering of its
keys. All keys inserted into the map must implement the `Comparable` interface. Furthermore, all such keys must be
mutually comparable: `k1.compareTo(k2)` must not throw
a `ClassCastException` for any keys `k1` and
`k2` in the map. If the user attempts to put a key into the
map that violates this constraint (for example, the user attempts to
put a string key into a map whose keys are integers), the
`put(Object key, Object value)` call will throw a
`ClassCastException`.

#### TreeMap

```
public TreeMap(Comparator<? super K> comparator)
```
Constructs a new, empty tree map, ordered according to the given
comparator. All keys inserted into the map must be mutually
comparable by the given comparator: `comparator.compare(k1,
k2)` must not throw a `ClassCastException` for any keys
`k1` and `k2` in the map. If the user attempts to put
a key into the map that violates this constraint, the `put(Object
key, Object value)` call will throw a
`ClassCastException`.
Parameters:
`comparator` - the comparator that will be used to order this map.
If `null`, the natural
ordering of the keys will be used.

#### TreeMap

```
public TreeMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
```
Constructs a new tree map containing the same mappings as the given
map, ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys.
All keys inserted into the new map must implement the `Comparable` interface. Furthermore, all such keys must be
mutually comparable: `k1.compareTo(k2)` must not throw
a `ClassCastException` for any keys `k1` and
`k2` in the map. This method runs in n\*log(n) time.
Parameters:
`m` - the map whose mappings are to be placed in this map
Throws:
`ClassCastException` - if the keys in m are not `Comparable`,
or are not mutually comparable
`NullPointerException` - if the specified map is null

#### TreeMap

```
public TreeMap(SortedMap<K,? extends V> m)
```
Constructs a new tree map containing the same mappings and
using the same ordering as the specified sorted map. This
method runs in linear time.
Parameters:
`m` - the sorted map whose mappings are to be placed in this map,
and whose comparator is to be used to sort this map
Throws:
`NullPointerException` - if the specified map is null

### Method Detail

#### size

```
public int size()
```
Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.
Specified by:
`size` in interface `Map<K,V>`
Overrides:
`size` in class `AbstractMap<K,V>`
Returns:
the number of key-value mappings in this map

#### containsKey

```
public boolean containsKey(Object key)
```
Returns `true` if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key.
Specified by:
`containsKey` in interface `Map<K,V>`
Overrides:
`containsKey` in class `AbstractMap<K,V>`
Parameters:
`key` - key whose presence in this map is to be tested
Returns:
`true` if this map contains a mapping for the
specified key
Throws:
`ClassCastException` - if the specified key cannot be compared
with the keys currently in the map
`NullPointerException` - if the specified key is null
and this map uses natural ordering, or its comparator
does not permit null keys

#### containsValue

```
public boolean containsValue(Object value)
```
Returns `true` if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value. More formally, returns `true` if and only if
this map contains at least one mapping to a value `v` such
that `(value==null ? v==null : value.equals(v))`. This
operation will probably require time linear in the map size for
most implementations.
Specified by:
`containsValue` in interface `Map<K,V>`
Overrides:
`containsValue` in class `AbstractMap<K,V>`
Parameters:
`value` - value whose presence in this map is to be tested
Returns:
`true` if a mapping to `value` exists;
`false` otherwise
Since:
1.2

#### get

```
public V get(Object key)
```
Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or `null` if this map contains no mapping for the key.More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key
`k` to a value `v` such that `key` compares
equal to `k` according to the map's ordering, then this
method returns `v`; otherwise it returns `null`.
(There can be at most one such mapping.)A return value of `null` does not necessarily
indicate that the map contains no mapping for the key; it's also
possible that the map explicitly maps the key to `null`.
The `containsKey` operation may be used to
distinguish these two cases.
Specified by:
`get` in interface `Map<K,V>`
Overrides:
`get` in class `AbstractMap<K,V>`
Parameters:
`key` - the key whose associated value is to be returned
Returns:
the value to which the specified key is mapped, or
`null` if this map contains no mapping for the key
Throws:
`ClassCastException` - if the specified key cannot be compared
with the keys currently in the map
`NullPointerException` - if the specified key is null
and this map uses natural ordering, or its comparator
does not permit null keys

#### comparator

public Comparator<? super K> comparator()
```
Description copied from interface: `SortedMap`
Returns the comparator used to order the keys in this map, or
`null` if this map uses the natural ordering of its keys.
Specified by:
`comparator` in interface `SortedMap<K,V>`
Returns:
the comparator used to order the keys in this map,
or `null` if this map uses the natural ordering
of its keys

These mappings replace any mappings that this map had for any
of the keys currently in the specified map.
Specified by:
`putAll` in interface `Map<K,V>`
Overrides:
`putAll` in class `AbstractMap<K,V>`
Parameters:
`map` - mappings to be stored in this map
Throws:
`ClassCastException` - if the class of a key or value in
the specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
`NullPointerException` - if the specified map is null or
the specified map contains a null key and this map does not
permit null keys

#### put

```
public V put(K key,
             V value)
```

If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old
value is replaced.
Specified by:
`put` in interface `Map<K,V>`
Overrides:
`put` in class `AbstractMap<K,V>`
Parameters:
`key` - key with which the specified value is to be associated
`value` - value to be associated with the specified key
Returns:
the previous value associated with `key`, or
`null` if there was no mapping for `key`.
(A `null` return can also indicate that the map
previously associated `null` with `key`.)
Throws:
`ClassCastException` - if the specified key cannot be compared
with the keys currently in the map
`NullPointerException` - if the specified key is null
and this map uses natural ordering, or its comparator

fail-fast, and additionally reports `Spliterator.SORTED`
and `Spliterator.ORDERED` with an encounter order that is ascending
key order. The spliterator's comparator (see
`Spliterator.getComparator()`) is `null` if
the tree map's comparator (see `comparator()`) is `null`.
Otherwise, the spliterator's comparator is the same as or imposes the
same total ordering as the tree map's comparator.The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own `remove` operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the
`Iterator.remove`, `Set.remove`,
`removeAll`, `retainAll`, and `clear`
operations. It does not support the `add` or `addAll`
operations.

The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in
the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration
over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own `remove` operation), the results of the iteration are undefined. The

```
Description copied from interface: `NavigableMap`
Returns a reverse order `NavigableSet` view of the keys contained in this map.
The set's iterator returns the keys in descending order.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in
the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration
over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own `remove` operation), the results of the iteration are undefined. The
set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping
from the map, via the `Iterator.remove`, `Set.remove`,

#### values

```
public Collection<V> values()
```
Returns a `Collection` view of the values contained in this map.The collection's iterator returns the values in ascending order
of the corresponding keys. The collection's spliterator is
late-binding,
fail-fast, and additionally reports `Spliterator.ORDERED`
with an encounter order that is ascending order of the corresponding
keys.The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own `remove` operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the `Iterator.remove`,
`Collection.remove`, `removeAll`,
`retainAll` and `clear` operations. It does not
support the `add` or `addAll` operations.

#### entrySet

```
public Set<Map.Entry<K,V>> entrySet()
```
Returns a `Set` view of the mappings contained in this map.The set's iterator returns the entries in ascending key order. The
sets's spliterator is
late-binding,
fail-fast, and additionally reports `Spliterator.SORTED` and
`Spliterator.ORDERED` with an encounter order that is ascending key
order.The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own `remove` operation, or through the
`setValue` operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the `Iterator.remove`,
`Set.remove`, `removeAll`, `retainAll` and
`clear` operations. It does not support the
`add` or `addAll` operations.

#### descendingMap

```
public NavigableMap<K,V> descendingMap()
```
Description copied from interface: `NavigableMap`
Returns a reverse order view of the mappings contained in this map.
The descending map is backed by this map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the descending map, and vice-versa. If either map is
modified while an iteration over a collection view of either map
is in progress (except through the iterator's own `remove`
operation), the results of the iteration are undefined.The returned map has an ordering equivalent to
`Collections.reverseOrder`(comparator()).
The expression `m.descendingMap().descendingMap()` returns a
view of `m` essentially equivalent to `m`.
