java.util.concurrentClass ForkJoinPool
java.lang.Objectjava.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorServicejava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool
All Implemented Interfaces:
Executor, ExecutorService


```
public class ForkJoinPool
extends AbstractExecutorService
```
An `ExecutorService` for running `ForkJoinTask`s.
A `ForkJoinPool` provides the entry point for submissions
from non-`ForkJoinTask` clients, as well as management and
monitoring operations.A `ForkJoinPool` differs from other kinds of `ExecutorService` mainly by virtue of employing
work-stealing: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active
tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks
(as do most `ForkJoinTask`s), as well as when many small
tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients. Especially
when setting asyncMode to true in constructors, `ForkJoinPool`s may also be appropriate for use with event-style
tasks that are never joined.A static `commonPool()` is available and appropriate for
most applications. The common pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that
is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the common
pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly
reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent
use).For applications that require separate or custom pools, a `ForkJoinPool` may be constructed with a given target parallelism
level; by default, equal to the number of available processors.
The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads
by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker
threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join others.
However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked
I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested `ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker` interface enables extension of the kinds of
synchronization accommodated.In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
class provides status check methods (for example
`getStealCount()`) that are intended to aid in developing,
tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
`toString()` returns indications of pool state in a
convenient form for informal monitoring.As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
main task execution methods summarized in the following table.
These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool. The main
forms of these methods accept instances of `ForkJoinTask`,
but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain `Runnable`- or `Callable`- based activities as well. However,
tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead
use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using
async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case
there is little difference among choice of methods.

Summary of task execution methodsCall from non-fork/join clientsCall from within fork/join computationsArrange async execution`execute(ForkJoinTask)``ForkJoinTask.fork()`Await and obtain result`invoke(ForkJoinTask)``ForkJoinTask.invoke()`Arrange exec and obtain Future`submit(ForkJoinTask)``ForkJoinTask.fork()` (ForkJoinTasks are Futures)
The common pool is by default constructed with default
parameters, but these may be controlled by setting three
system properties:`java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism`
- the parallelism level, a non-negative integer`java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.threadFactory`
- the class name of a `ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory``java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.exceptionHandler`
- the class name of a `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`If a `SecurityManager` is present and no factory is
specified, then the default pool uses a factory supplying
threads that have no `Permissions` enabled.
The system class loader is used to load these classes.
Upon any error in establishing these settings, default parameters
are used. It is possible to disable or limit the use of threads in
the common pool by setting the parallelism property to zero, and/or
using a factory that may return `null`. However doing so may
cause unjoined tasks to never be executed.Implementation notes: This implementation restricts the
maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
pools with greater than the maximum number result in
`IllegalArgumentException`.This implementation rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing
`RejectedExecutionException`) only when the pool is shut down
or internal resources have been exhausted.
Since:
1.7

### Field Detail

#### defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory

```
public static final ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory
```
Creates a new ForkJoinWorkerThread. This factory is used unless
overridden in ForkJoinPool constructors.

### Constructor Detail

#### ForkJoinPool

```
public ForkJoinPool()
```
Creates a `ForkJoinPool` with parallelism equal to `Runtime.availableProcessors()`, using the default thread factory,
no UncaughtExceptionHandler, and non-async LIFO processing mode.
Throws:
`SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
the caller is not permitted to modify threads
because it does not hold `RuntimePermission``("modifyThread")`

#### ForkJoinPool

```
public ForkJoinPool(int parallelism)
```
Creates a `ForkJoinPool` with the indicated parallelism
level, the default thread factory,
no UncaughtExceptionHandler, and non-async LIFO processing mode.
Parameters:
`parallelism` - the parallelism level
Throws:
`IllegalArgumentException` - if parallelism less than or
equal to zero, or greater than implementation limit
`SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
the caller is not permitted to modify threads
because it does not hold `RuntimePermission``("modifyThread")`

#### ForkJoinPool

```
public ForkJoinPool(int parallelism,
                    ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory factory,
                    Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler,
                    boolean asyncMode)
```
Creates a `ForkJoinPool` with the given parameters.
Parameters:
`parallelism` - the parallelism level. For default value,
use `Runtime.availableProcessors()`.
`factory` - the factory for creating new threads. For default value,
use `defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory`.
`handler` - the handler for internal worker threads that
terminate due to unrecoverable errors encountered while executing
tasks. For default value, use `null`.
`asyncMode` - if true,
establishes local first-in-first-out scheduling mode for forked
tasks that are never joined. This mode may be more appropriate
than default locally stack-based mode in applications in which
worker threads only process event-style asynchronous tasks.
For default value, use `false`.
Throws:
`IllegalArgumentException` - if parallelism less than or
equal to zero, or greater than implementation limit
`NullPointerException` - if the factory is null
`SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
the caller is not permitted to modify threads
because it does not hold `RuntimePermission``("modifyThread")`

### Method Detail

#### commonPool

```
public static ForkJoinPool commonPool()
```
Returns the common pool instance. This pool is statically
constructed; its run state is unaffected by attempts to `shutdown()` or `shutdownNow()`. However this pool and any
ongoing processing are automatically terminated upon program
`System.exit(int)`. Any program that relies on asynchronous
task processing to complete before program termination should
invoke `commonPool().``awaitQuiescence`,
before exit.
Returns:
the common pool instance
Since:
1.8

#### invoke

```
public <T> T invoke(ForkJoinTask<T> task)
```
Performs the given task, returning its result upon completion.
If the computation encounters an unchecked Exception or Error,
it is rethrown as the outcome of this invocation. Rethrown
exceptions behave in the same way as regular exceptions, but,
when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed for example
using `ex.printStackTrace()`) of both the current thread
as well as the thread actually encountering the exception;
minimally only the latter.
Type Parameters:
`T` - the type of the task's result
Parameters:
`task` - the task
Returns:
the task's result
Throws:
`NullPointerException` - if the task is null
`RejectedExecutionException` - if the task cannot be
scheduled for execution

#### execute

```
public void execute(ForkJoinTask<?> task)
```
Arranges for (asynchronous) execution of the given task.
Parameters:
`task` - the task

Description copied from interface: `Executor`
Executes the given command at some time in the future. The command
may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling
thread, at the discretion of the `Executor` implementation.

```
public <T> ForkJoinTask<T> submit(Callable<T> task)
```
Description copied from interface: `ExecutorService`
Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a
Future representing the pending results of the task. The
Future's `get` method will return the task's result upon
successful completion.If you would like to immediately block waiting
for a task, you can use constructions of the form
`result = exec.submit(aCallable).get();`Note: The `Executors` class includes a set of methods
that can convert some other common closure-like objects,
for example, `PrivilegedAction` to
`Callable` form so they can be submitted.
Specified by:

```
Description copied from interface: `ExecutorService`
Executes the given tasks, returning a list of Futures holding
their status and results when all complete.
`Future.isDone()` is `true` for each

Overrides:
`invokeAll` in class `AbstractExecutorService`
Type Parameters:
`T` - the type of the values returned from the tasks
Parameters:
`tasks` - the collection of tasks
Returns:
a list of Futures representing the tasks, in the same
sequential order as produced by the iterator for the
given task list, each of which has completed
Throws:
`NullPointerException` - if tasks or any of its elements are `null`
`RejectedExecutionException` - if any task cannot be
scheduled for execution

#### getFactory

```
public ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory getFactory()
```
Returns the factory used for constructing new workers.
Returns:
the factory used for constructing new workers

#### getUncaughtExceptionHandler

```
public Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler getUncaughtExceptionHandler()
```
Returns the handler for internal worker threads that terminate
due to unrecoverable errors encountered while executing tasks.
Returns:
the handler, or `null` if none

#### getParallelism

```
public int getParallelism()
```
Returns the targeted parallelism level of this pool.
Returns:
the targeted parallelism level of this pool

#### getCommonPoolParallelism

```
public static int getCommonPoolParallelism()
```
Returns the targeted parallelism level of the common pool.
Returns:
the targeted parallelism level of the common pool
Since:
1.8

#### getPoolSize

```
public int getPoolSize()
```
Returns the number of worker threads that have started but not
yet terminated. The result returned by this method may differ
from `getParallelism()` when threads are created to
maintain parallelism when others are cooperatively blocked.
Returns:
the number of worker threads

#### getAsyncMode

```
public boolean getAsyncMode()
```
Returns `true` if this pool uses local first-in-first-out
scheduling mode for forked tasks that are never joined.
Returns:
`true` if this pool uses async mode

#### getRunningThreadCount

```
public int getRunningThreadCount()
```
Returns an estimate of the number of worker threads that are
not blocked waiting to join tasks or for other managed
synchronization. This method may overestimate the
number of running threads.
Returns:
the number of worker threads

#### getActiveThreadCount

```
public int getActiveThreadCount()
```
Returns an estimate of the number of threads that are currently
stealing or executing tasks. This method may overestimate the
number of active threads.
Returns:
the number of active threads

#### isQuiescent

```
public boolean isQuiescent()
```
Returns `true` if all worker threads are currently idle.
An idle worker is one that cannot obtain a task to execute
because none are available to steal from other threads, and
there are no pending submissions to the pool. This method is
conservative; it might not return `true` immediately upon
idleness of all threads, but will eventually become true if
threads remain inactive.
Returns:
`true` if all threads are currently idle

#### getStealCount

```
public long getStealCount()
```
Returns an estimate of the total number of tasks stolen from
one thread's work queue by another. The reported value
underestimates the actual total number of steals when the pool
is not quiescent. This value may be useful for monitoring and
tuning fork/join programs: in general, steal counts should be
high enough to keep threads busy, but low enough to avoid
overhead and contention across threads.
Returns:
the number of steals

#### getQueuedTaskCount

```
public long getQueuedTaskCount()
```
Returns an estimate of the total number of tasks currently held
in queues by worker threads (but not including tasks submitted
to the pool that have not begun executing). This value is only
an approximation, obtained by iterating across all threads in
the pool. This method may be useful for tuning task
granularities.
Returns:
the number of queued tasks

#### getQueuedSubmissionCount

```
public int getQueuedSubmissionCount()
```
Returns an estimate of the number of tasks submitted to this
pool that have not yet begun executing. This method may take
time proportional to the number of submissions.
Returns:
the number of queued submissions

#### hasQueuedSubmissions

```
public boolean hasQueuedSubmissions()
```
Returns `true` if there are any tasks submitted to this
pool that have not yet begun executing.
Returns:
`true` if there are any queued submissions

#### pollSubmission

```
protected ForkJoinTask<?> pollSubmission()
```
Removes and returns the next unexecuted submission if one is
available. This method may be useful in extensions to this
class that re-assign work in systems with multiple pools.
Returns:
the next submission, or `null` if none

#### drainTasksTo

```
protected int drainTasksTo(Collection<? super ForkJoinTask<?>> c)
```
Removes all available unexecuted submitted and forked tasks
from scheduling queues and adds them to the given collection,
without altering their execution status. These may include
artificially generated or wrapped tasks. This method is
designed to be invoked only when the pool is known to be
quiescent. Invocations at other times may not remove all
tasks. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements
to collection `c` may result in elements being in
neither, either or both collections when the associated
exception is thrown. The behavior of this operation is
undefined if the specified collection is modified while the
operation is in progress.
Parameters:
`c` - the collection to transfer elements into
Returns:
the number of elements transferred

#### toString

```
public String toString()
```
Returns a string identifying this pool, as well as its state,
including indications of run state, parallelism level, and
worker and task counts.
Overrides:
`toString` in class `Object`
Returns:
a string identifying this pool, as well as its state

#### shutdown

```
public void shutdown()
```
Possibly initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously
submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be
accepted. Invocation has no effect on execution state if this
is the `commonPool()`, and no additional effect if
already shut down. Tasks that are in the process of being
submitted concurrently during the course of this method may or
may not be rejected.
Throws:
`SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
the caller is not permitted to modify threads
because it does not hold `RuntimePermission``("modifyThread")`

#### shutdownNow

```
public List<Runnable> shutdownNow()
```
Possibly attempts to cancel and/or stop all tasks, and reject
all subsequently submitted tasks. Invocation has no effect on
execution state if this is the `commonPool()`, and no
additional effect if already shut down. Otherwise, tasks that
are in the process of being submitted or executed concurrently
during the course of this method may or may not be
rejected. This method cancels both existing and unexecuted
tasks, in order to permit termination in the presence of task
dependencies. So the method always returns an empty list
(unlike the case for some other Executors).
Returns:
an empty list
Throws:
`SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
the caller is not permitted to modify threads
because it does not hold `RuntimePermission``("modifyThread")`

#### isTerminated

```
public boolean isTerminated()
```
Returns `true` if all tasks have completed following shut down.
Returns:
`true` if all tasks have completed following shut down

#### isTerminating

```
public boolean isTerminating()
```
Returns `true` if the process of termination has
commenced but not yet completed. This method may be useful for
debugging. A return of `true` reported a sufficient
period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have
ignored or suppressed interruption, or are waiting for I/O,
causing this executor not to properly terminate. (See the
advisory notes for class `ForkJoinTask` stating that
tasks should not normally entail blocking operations. But if
they do, they must abort them on interrupt.)
Returns:
`true` if terminating but not yet terminated

#### isShutdown

```
public boolean isShutdown()
```
Returns `true` if this pool has been shut down.
Returns:
`true` if this pool has been shut down

#### awaitTermination

```
public boolean awaitTermination(long timeout,
                                TimeUnit unit)
                         throws InterruptedException
```
Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a
shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread
is interrupted, whichever happens first. Because the `commonPool()` never terminates until program shutdown, when
applied to the common pool, this method is equivalent to `awaitQuiescence(long, TimeUnit)` but always returns `false`.
Parameters:
`timeout` - the maximum time to wait
`unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument
Returns:
`true` if this executor terminated and
`false` if the timeout elapsed before termination
Throws:
`InterruptedException` - if interrupted while waiting

#### awaitQuiescence

```
public boolean awaitQuiescence(long timeout,
                               TimeUnit unit)
```
If called by a ForkJoinTask operating in this pool, equivalent
in effect to `ForkJoinTask.helpQuiesce()`. Otherwise,
waits and/or attempts to assist performing tasks until this
pool `isQuiescent()` or the indicated timeout elapses.
Parameters:
`timeout` - the maximum time to wait
`unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument
Returns:
`true` if quiescent; `false` if the
timeout elapsed.

#### managedBlock

```
public static void managedBlock(ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker blocker)
                         throws InterruptedException
```
Runs the given possibly blocking task. When running in a ForkJoinPool, this
method possibly arranges for a spare thread to be activated if
necessary to ensure sufficient parallelism while the current
thread is blocked in `blocker.block()`.This method repeatedly calls `blocker.isReleasable()` and
`blocker.block()` until either method returns `true`.
Every call to `blocker.block()` is preceded by a call to
`blocker.isReleasable()` that returned `false`.If not running in a ForkJoinPool, this method is
behaviorally equivalent to
```
 
 while (!blocker.isReleasable())
   if (blocker.block())
     break;
```
If running in a ForkJoinPool, the pool may first be expanded to
ensure sufficient parallelism available during the call to
`blocker.block()`.
Parameters:
`blocker` - the blocker task
Throws:
`InterruptedException` - if `blocker.block()` did so
