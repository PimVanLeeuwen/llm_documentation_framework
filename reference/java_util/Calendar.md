public abstract class Calendar
extends Object
implements Serializable, Cloneable, Comparable<Calendar>
```
The `Calendar` class is an abstract class that provides methods
for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of `calendar fields` such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`,
`DAY_OF_MONTH`, `HOUR`, and so on, and for
manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next
week. An instant in time can be represented by a millisecond value that is
an offset from the Epoch, January 1, 1970
00:00:00.000 GMT (Gregorian).The class also provides additional fields and methods for
implementing a concrete calendar system outside the package. Those
fields and methods are defined as `protected`.Like other locale-sensitive classes, `Calendar` provides a
class method, `getInstance`, for getting a generally useful
object of this type. `Calendar`'s `getInstance` method
returns a `Calendar` object whose
calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
```

     Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
 
```
A `Calendar` object can produce all the calendar field values
needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and
calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).
`Calendar` defines the range of values returned by
certain calendar fields, as well as their meaning. For example,
the first month of the calendar system has value `MONTH ==
JANUARY` for all calendars. Other values are defined by the
concrete subclass, such as `ERA`. See individual field
documentation and subclass documentation for details.
