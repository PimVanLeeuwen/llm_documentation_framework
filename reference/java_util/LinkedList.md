public class LinkedList<E>
extends AbstractSequentialList<E>
implements List<E>, Deque<E>, Cloneable, Serializable
```
Doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` and `Deque`
interfaces. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
elements (including `null`).All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.Note that this implementation is not synchronized.
If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be
synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation
that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
an element is not a structural modification.) This is typically
accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
encapsulates the list.
If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
`Collections.synchronizedList`
method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the list:
```

   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));
```
The iterators returned by this class's `iterator` and
`listIterator` methods are fail-fast: if the list is
structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
any way except through the Iterator's own `remove` or
`add` methods, the iterator will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw `ConcurrentModificationException` on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.This class is a member of the
Java Collections Framework.
