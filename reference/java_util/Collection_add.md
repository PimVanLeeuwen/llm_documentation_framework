#### add

```
boolean add(E e)
```
Ensures that this collection contains the specified element (optional
operation). Returns true if this collection changed as a
result of the call. (Returns false if this collection does
not permit duplicates and already contains the specified element.)Collections that support this operation may place limitations on what
elements may be added to this collection. In particular, some
collections will refuse to add null elements, and others will
impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added.
Collection classes should clearly specify in their documentation any
restrictions on what elements may be added.If a collection refuses to add a particular element for any reason
other than that it already contains the element, it must throw
an exception (rather than returning false). This preserves
the invariant that a collection always contains the specified element
after this call returns.
Parameters:
`e` - element whose presence in this collection is to be ensured
Returns:
true if this collection changed as a result of the
call
Throws:
`UnsupportedOperationException` - if the add operation
is not supported by this collection
`ClassCastException` - if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this collection
`NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
collection does not permit null elements
`IllegalArgumentException` - if some property of the element
prevents it from being added to this collection
`IllegalStateException` - if the element cannot be added at this
time due to insertion restrictions
