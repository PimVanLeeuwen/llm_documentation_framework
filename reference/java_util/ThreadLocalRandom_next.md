#### next

```
protected int next(int bits)
```
Description copied from class: `Random`
Generates the next pseudorandom number. Subclasses should
override this, as this is used by all other methods.The general contract of `next` is that it returns an
`int` value and if the argument `bits` is between
`1` and `32` (inclusive), then that many low-order
bits of the returned value will be (approximately) independently
chosen bit values, each of which is (approximately) equally
likely to be `0` or `1`. The method `next` is
implemented by class `Random` by atomically updating the seed to
```
 (seed * 0x5DEECE66DL + 0xBL) & ((1L << 48) - 1)
```
and returning
```
 (int)(seed >>> (48 - bits)).
```
This is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator, as
defined by D. H. Lehmer and described by Donald E. Knuth in
The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3:
Seminumerical Algorithms, section 3.2.1.
Overrides:
`next` in class `Random`
Parameters:
`bits` - random bits
Returns:
the next pseudorandom value from this random number
generator's sequence
